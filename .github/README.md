#	Web development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Hi there! I wanted to share with you that I'm using this repository to keep track of the exercises assigned in Alura's web development course. 

It covers HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and as I go through the lessons, I'll be working on the project outlined in the syllabus and improving it. 

I'd love for you to take a look at my codes whenever you have a chance!
